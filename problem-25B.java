Imagine youâ€˜re building a calculator that can perform different arithmetic
operations. Write a program that uses a `do-while` loop and a `switch`
statement to handle user input and perform calculations. How will you set up
your program to repeatedly ask for input and execute operations like
addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division based on user choice?
