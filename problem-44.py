44) WIPRO 2023 - The Prime Range Riddle
In the kingdom of numbers, you are given a range of integers and need to
determine how many of them are prime. Your quest is to count all the prime
numbers that lie within this specified range.
The Challenge:
1. Receive the Range: You are provided with two integers, start and end,
which define the inclusive range [start, end].
2. Identify Prime Numbers: Determine which numbers within this range are
prime.
3. Count the Primes: Calculate the total number of prime numbers in this
range.
4. Return the Count: Provide the number of primes found.
Rules to Follow:
 A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive
divisors other than 1 and itself.
 For example, in the range [10, 50], the prime numbers are 11, 13, 17, 19,
23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47.
Example:
 Given Range: 10 to 50
o Primes in this Range: 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47
o Total Count of Primes: 10
Can you solve the Prime Range Riddle and find out how many prime
numbers lie between the given start and end values?
