Youâ€˜re tasked with creating a simple calculator using a `while` loop and a
`switch` statement. Your program should repeatedly prompt the user to
choose an arithmetic operation (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or
division) and then perform the selected operation based on user input. How
will you set up your `while` loop and `switch` case to keep the calculator
running until the user decides to exit?
