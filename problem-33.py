"""
33. You have a number and need to check if it belongs to the Fibonacci
sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Write a
method to determine if this number is part of the Fibonacci series. Return
`true` if it is, and `false` if it isnâ€˜t. How will you uncover whether this number
fits into the famous Fibonacci pattern?
