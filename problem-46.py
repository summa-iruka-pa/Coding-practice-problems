"""
46) You have a number and need to check if it is an Armstrong number.
An Armstrong number is one where the sum of the cubes of its digits equals
the number itself. Write a method to test this property.
How will you design your method to compute the cubes of the digits, add
them up, and confirm if the total matches the original number?
